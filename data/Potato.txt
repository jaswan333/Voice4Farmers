Potato growers should be aware of the symptoms of late blight, a disease that causes water-soaked, dark green to black lesions on leaves that rapidly turn brown and die, often with a white, fuzzy fungal growth on the underside in humid conditions. Stems may also show dark brown lesions, and tubers develop firm, brown, sunken lesions that extend inward, causing rot in storage. To manage late blight, use blight-tolerant or moderately resistant varieties where available. Spray Mancozeb or similar contact fungicides at a 0.2-0.3% solution starting at 45 days after planting and repeat 2-3 times at 10-day intervals in high-risk weather. In severe cases, a 1-2 sprays of metalaxyl-M or other systemic fungicides may be added as per advisory. It is essential to avoid excessive nitrogen and maintain good drainage to prevent the spread of the disease.

To prevent late blight, use healthy, disease-free seed tubers and avoid planting near infected fields. Maintain proper spacing and airflow on ridges. Avoid overhead irrigation and minimize prolonged leaf wetness. Destroy infected crop debris and practice crop rotation with non-solanaceous crops.

Early blight causes small, dark brown lesions with concentric rings on older leaves, giving a target-like appearance. Affected leaves turn yellow and dry out, and severe infection leads to premature defoliation and reduced tuber size and number. To manage early blight, use resistant or tolerant varieties where possible. Apply Mancozeb or chlorothalonil at a 0.2-0.3% solution once early lesions appear and repeat 1-2 times at 10-day intervals. Avoid high-nitrogen doses and maintain balanced NPK to reduce disease severity.

Preventing early blight involves using disease-free seed and practicing crop rotation with non-solanaceous crops. Avoid continuous potato cropping. Maintain proper spacing and drainage, and remove and destroy infected plant debris after harvest. Avoid working in fields when foliage is wet.

Black leg, caused by Erwinia carotovora, is a disease that causes blackening and rotting of the stem base, often starting from the seed tuber. The plant shows stunted growth, yellowing of lower leaves, and wilting; in severe cases, the whole plant collapses and dies. When the stem is cut, the vascular tissue is dark brown and may ooze in wet conditions. There is no effective cure once plants are severely infected, so it is essential to remove and destroy infected plants along with surrounding soil. Use disease-free seed tubers and treat them with hot-water or bactericide dips, such as streptomycin-based or copper-based bactericides, before planting.

To prevent black leg, avoid planting in poorly drained, water-logged fields. Use certified seed and rotate potato with non-host crops. Avoid overcrowding and maintain good drainage.

To manage bacterial wilt in potato, it is essential to avoid using tubers from infected fields as seed and to practice strict field sanitation. Bacterial wilt causes sudden wilting, starting with lower leaves, followed by yellowing and browning of the entire plant while leaves remain green. When the stem is cut and placed in water, a milky oozing streak appears, and the vascular tissue turns brown. Infected plants and surrounding soil should be removed and destroyed, and infected soil should not be reused for potato without long-term crop rotation or soil solarization. Seed tubers should be treated with hot-water or approved bactericides, if recommended.

To prevent bacterial wilt, use disease-free seed and avoid planting in fields with a history of bacterial wilt. Rotate with non-solanaceous crops, maintain good drainage, and avoid continuous solanaceous cropping. Practicing strict field sanitation and avoiding farm-yard manure contaminated with infected material are also crucial.

Soft rot in potato appears as soft, watery, brown or black lesions on tubers that rapidly spread, turning the whole tuber into a mushy, foul-smelling mass. In the field, attacking tubers may rot underground, and in storage, the disease spreads quickly from tuber to tuber. To manage soft rot, sort out soft or bruised tubers immediately after harvest and use clean, dry, cool storage conditions. Avoid stacking tubers too deep, and apply recommended fungicides or bio-fungicides on seed tubers before planting to reduce secondary rot pathogens.

To prevent soft rot, avoid mechanical injury during harvesting and transport, and do not store tubers with visible rot or bruises. Maintain dry, well-ventilated storage at recommended temperature (around 8-10 °C) and relative humidity (85-90%), and practice crop rotation and field sanitation.

Black scurf in potato appears as small, dark brown to black, irregular encrustations (sclerotia) on the surface of tubers. Infected seed tubers may show stunted sprouts or failed emergence, and on stems, black scurf can cause stem canker and poor growth. To manage black scurf, treat seed tubers with recommended fungicides such as thiabendazole, carbendazim, boric acid, or acetic-acid + zinc-sulfate dips before planting. Use resistant varieties where available and avoid reuse of infected seed for multiple seasons.

To prevent black scurf, use certified, disease-free seed and practice crop rotation (e.g., with cereals or dhaincha). Avoid continuous potato cropping, and treat soil or seedbed with appropriate fungicides or bio-agents in high-risk areas.

To manage common scab in potato, it is essential to remove and destroy infected tubers and residues. This disease causes rough, corky, brown or black, slightly sunken lesions on the surface of tubers, reducing marketability. Common scab is more severe in light, sandy soils with high pH and low organic matter. To prevent the disease, growers should maintain slightly acidic soil with a pH around 5-5.5 and increase organic matter through green manuring or FYM. Crop rotation with non-host crops and avoiding over-liming in scab-prone soils are also crucial. Additionally, growers should use certified seed and avoid continuous potato cropping. Maintaining good drainage and uniform soil moisture, and avoiding drought stress during tuber-skin formation, can also help prevent the disease.

To manage dry rot and silver scurf in potato, growers should sort and cull infected tubers after harvest. Using fungicide-treated or bio-agent-treated seed tubers can also be effective. In storage, maintaining cool, dry, well-ventilated conditions with moderate humidity can slow the spread of the disease. To prevent dry rot and silver scurf, growers should use disease-free seed and avoid planting in fields with a history of severe dry rot or silver scurf. Crop rotation and avoiding continuous potato cropping can also help prevent the disease. Furthermore, growers should avoid mechanical injury during harvest and transport, and maintain field sanitation.

The Colorado potato beetle is a significant pest of potato, causing damage to leaves and reducing yields. Both adults and larvae feed on potato leaves, creating shot-hole-like or large irregular holes, leading to skeletonized foliage. To manage this pest, growers should use potato-specific pesticides and maintain good field sanitation.



Heavy infestation of the crop can cause severe defoliation, reduced photosynthesis, and stunted tuber growth. To manage this issue, pesticides such as Chlorpyrifos 20 EC can be sprayed at a rate of 2.5-3.0 litres per hectare or an equivalent dose as per the label. Alternatively, other recommended organophosphates like Dimethoate 30 EC at a 0.03-0.05% solution can be used in severe outbreaks, following safety intervals and maximum spray-limit rules.

Regular scouting of fields is essential to identify beetles or larvae as soon as they appear, and spraying should be done immediately. If pest pressure is high, repeat spraying 1-2 times at 7-10-day intervals. Spot-spraying is preferred over blanket sprays where feasible. To prevent infestation, rotate the potato crop with non-solanaceous crops to reduce over-wintering beetles. Remove wild Solanum hosts and weeds around fields, and encourage natural enemies like ladybugs and lacewings through less-harmful pesticide use and IPM-based practices.

Aphids cluster on the undersides of leaves and tender shoots, sucking sap and secreting honeydew, causing curling, yellowing, and stunted growth. They also transmit viral diseases such as potato leaf roll virus and potato virus Y. To manage aphid infestation, soil application of Phorate 10 G at 1.5 kg active ingredient per hectare at planting can reduce early aphid builds. Spray Dimethoate 30 EC at a 0.03-0.05% solution or similar insecticides like Imidacloprid 17.8 SL at label dose when aphids appear. Start spraying at the first sign of colonization and repeat every 7-10 days until the population is under control. Avoid excessive nitrogen, which increases aphid attraction.

Prevention of aphid infestation can be achieved by using resistant or tolerant varieties where available. Introduce biological control agents like lady beetles and parasitoid wasps, and maintain field sanitation by removing alternate weed hosts.

Infested tubers show dark, dirty tunnels and can be completely hollowed out in storage. This damage can significantly reduce the yield and marketability of the crop. To manage this issue, it is essential to implement effective storage practices. Healthy tubers should be stored in moth-proof structures, and the storage areas should be kept clean to prevent infestation.

For pest control, pesticides such as Monocrotophos 40 EC can be used. However, it is crucial to follow local rules and regulations regarding the use of this chemical. An alternative approach is to adopt IPM-oriented systems, which recommend the use of safer alternatives like Spinosad, neem-based sprays, or bio-pesticides. In addition to chemical control, pheromone-baited traps can be used to monitor and reduce male moth numbers. These traps should be placed in the field and storage areas at a rate of 4 traps per 100 square meters.

To prevent infestation, it is essential to avoid leaving leftover tubers in the field after harvest. Deep-planting seed tubers and covering exposed tubers with soil can also reduce larval access. Furthermore, practicing crop rotation and destroying crop residues can help reduce over-seasoning populations.

Cutworms are another significant pest that can cause damage to potato crops. These pests feed at night, severing young potato stems at the soil level or boring into seed-tubers, causing plant death and reduced stand. Tunnels and holes in tubers can also reduce yield and marketability. To manage cutworms, pre-plant soil drench or ridge application with Chlorpyrifos 20 EC can be used as per label directions. Other recommended insecticides, such as Quinalphos 25 EC, can also be used where permitted, following safety intervals.

Effective management of cutworms involves applying insecticides at the planting or early seedling stage when the pests are first observed. Following up with scouting and spot-treating infested patches can also help control the population. Prevention is key, and deep ploughing in hot weather or early ploughing in hills can expose and kill larvae and pupae. Encouraging birds that feed on exposed cutworms can also be an effective control method. Additionally, practicing crop rotation and avoiding continuous solanaceous cropping can help reduce the risk of infestation.

White grubs are another pest that can cause significant damage to potato crops. These pests feed on roots and underground stems and may also damage developing tubers, creating tunnels and causing stunted growth or complete plant death. Effective management of white grubs involves adopting integrated pest management strategies that include crop rotation, avoiding continuous solanaceous cropping, and encouraging beneficial insects that prey on the grubs.



Fields with heavy infestation often show patchy, yellowing stands. To manage this issue, apply systemic insecticides such as Imidacloprid 17.8 SL or similar neonicotinoids as a soil drench at planting where recommended. Alternatively, use other recommended organophosphates or carbamates as per local advisory and safety norms.

Scouting the field for grubs by digging in different spots before planting and during early growth is essential. This helps identify areas that require targeted treatment rather than blanket treatment. Treat the soil in known infested patches to minimize unnecessary chemical application.

Preventing grub infestation involves repeated ploughing before the monsoon to expose grubs and pupae for birds and natural mortality. Practicing crop rotation with cereals or legumes can also help reduce the risk of infestation. Incorporating neem-cake or other bio-agents into the soil can suppress soil-dwelling larvae.

Red Spider Mite (Tetranychus spp.) infestation on potato crops causes mites to feed on the undersides of leaves, resulting in yellow mottling, bronzing, and fine webbing. In severe cases, leaves dry up and plants become stunted, reducing tuber size and yield. To manage this issue, spray Dicofol 18.5 EC or Quinalphos 25 EC at 2.0 litres per hectare as per advisory, or other recommended miticides. Neem-based or sulfur-based products can also be used for mite suppression.

Applying miticides as soon as mites are detected and repeating at 7-10-day intervals depending on persistence is crucial. Ensure good coverage of the undersides of leaves to maximize the effectiveness of the treatment. Maintaining adequate irrigation and avoiding water stress can also help prevent mite buildup. Using light traps and removing dust-laden or dusty vegetation around fields can further reduce the risk of infestation. Encouraging predatory mites and other natural enemies through reduced broad-spectrum pesticide use can also be beneficial.

For general cultivation practices, choose healthy, disease-free seed tubers of suitable varieties such as Kufri Jyoti, Kufri Bahar, Kufri Pukhraj, Kufri Chandramukhi, or other ICAR-recommended cultivars. Treat seed tubers with recommended fungicides before planting to reduce seed-borne diseases. Grow potato in well-drained, friable sandy loam or loam soil with good organic matter, and maintain soil pH around 4.8-5.4 where possible, especially in acid-soil areas. Prepare the land by deep ploughing followed by harrowing to achieve a fine tilth, and form ridges or raised beds to ensure good drainage and easy earthing-up. Follow the recommended planting season, generally Rabi planting from late September to November when maximum temperature is around 30-32 °C and minimum about 18-20 °C, or in spring, plant in the second fortnight of January in suitable regions.



When planting potatoes, it is essential to use seed tubers weighing about 30-50 grams each, spaced at approximately 50-60 centimeters between rows and 15-20 centimeters between plants. Plant the seed tubers at a 5-7 centimeter depth on ridges, ensuring the sprouts are upwards and covered with loose soil. Adequate organic manure or compost, along with balanced NPK as per region-specific advisories, should be applied to the soil. This typically involves applying 10-20 tons of manure per hectare, along with 100-150 kilograms of nitrogen, 60-100 kilograms of phosphorus, and 100-180 kilograms of potassium per hectare, split as per the advisory. It is also crucial to ensure micro-nutrients like boron and zinc are added if soil tests show a deficiency.

Frequent, light irrigation should be maintained starting 5-7 days after planting, keeping the soil moist but avoiding waterlogging. The irrigation should be increased at the tuber-initiation and bulking stages, then reduced near harvest to harden the tubers and reduce rot. Earthing-up, or hilling, should be performed when the plants are 10-12 centimeters tall to cover exposed tubers, control weeds, and support root and tuber development. Crop rotation is also essential, as it helps reduce the build-up of soil-borne diseases and nematodes. Avoid continuous potato or other solanaceous crops and rotate with cereals, pulses, or crucifers.

Proactive control of pests and diseases is crucial. Monitor for early blight, late blight, blackleg, soft rot, and potato tuber moth, and apply protective fungicide sprays at recommended intervals in high-risk periods. Field sanitation is also vital, as removing and destroying diseased plants and cull-piles can help prevent disease spread. Avoid dumping infected tubers near the field and minimize field traffic in wet conditions to reduce disease spread.

It is essential to avoid using mechanical damage or bruised, diseased, or oversized tubers as seed, as this can lead to poor crop performance. Similarly, planting seed from fields with known late blight, early blight, soft rot, or blackleg outbreaks without proper seed-treatment and isolation can result in disease spread. Planting in poorly drained, heavy clay, or water-logging-prone soils without proper bed preparation and drainage can encourage tuber rots and blackleg. Over-applying nitrogen, especially late-stage nitrogen, can promote excessive top-growth and delay tuber maturity while increasing susceptibility to blight and other diseases.


When storing or selling potatoes, it is essential to remove any tubers with visible signs of rot, soft spots, or blackleg lesions. These diseased tubers should be culled out immediately after harvest to prevent the spread of disease. To maintain the quality of the remaining tubers, store them in cool, dry, well-ventilated conditions.

Early signs of blight, blackleg, or tuber soft rot should not be ignored. Delaying scouting and spray schedules will only increase losses and contaminate seed stocks for the next season, making it crucial to monitor the crop regularly and take prompt action to prevent the spread of disease.
