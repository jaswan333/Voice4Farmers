For optimal growth, chilli should be cultivated in well-drained, loamy to sandy loam soils rich in organic matter, with a pH ranging from 6.0 to 7.5. Avoid heavy clay, water-logged, or highly saline/alkaline soils as they can hinder the plant's growth. To prepare the land, perform 2-3 deep ploughings to achieve a fine tilth, and incorporate 10-15 tons per hectare of well-decomposed farm yard manure or compost along with Azospirillum and Phosphobacteria during the last ploughing.

When sowing seeds, use 300-400 grams per hectare in the nursery, and raise seedlings in raised beds. Treat the seeds with fungicides or Trichoderma to prevent diseases, and transplant healthy 30-40-day-old seedlings on ridges at 60x45 cm spacing or as per local advisory. Provide balanced NPK nutrition, often in the range of 75-125 kg N, 50-75 kg P, and 50-75 kg K per hectare, split as per soil test and recommendations, while avoiding excessive nitrogen.

Maintain regular, light irrigation, especially during flowering and fruiting, using drip or furrow irrigation. Avoid waterlogging and long-term dry stress to reduce blossom and fruit drop. Perform earthing-up about 30 days after transplanting and mulch with straw or dried leaves to conserve moisture and suppress weeds. Additionally, practice crop rotation with non-solanaceous crops, such as cereals, pulses, and crucifers, to reduce the build-up of soil-borne diseases, nematodes, and pests.

It is essential to use high-quality seedlings and avoid transplanting weak, diseased, or overcrowded seedlings. Also, refrain from planting in heavy clay, water-logged, or highly acidic/alkaline soils without proper correction and drainage. Applying high-dose nitrogen, especially during flowering and fruiting, can increase blossom drop, pest attraction, and disease susceptibility. Avoid continuous cultivation of chilli or other solanaceous crops in the same field, as this increases soil-borne pathogens and nematodes.

Weeds can significantly compete with chilli, reduce yield, and shelter pests and diseases. Regularly monitor the field for early signs of major diseases, such as damping-off, wilt, Cercospora, and viruses, or pests, like thrips, aphids, and fruit borers. Delaying control measures can lead to significant losses. Finally, avoid dumping infected plant remnants, culls, or diseased fruits near the field, as this creates a continuous source of inoculum.

To prevent damping-off and seedling-rot, treat seeds with fungicides, such as carbendazim, mancozeb, or Trichoderma, before sowing. Use raised, well-drained nursery beds and avoid over-watering to prevent the development of these diseases.


For severely affected nurseries, apply a soil drench with metalaxyl or carbendazim at the recommended doses to prevent the spread of disease. To prevent disease in the first place, it is essential to use clean, disease-free nursery soil and trays. Overcrowding should be avoided, and good aeration maintained. Excessive watering should be minimized, and treated irrigation water used. Crop rotation and field sanitation are also crucial in reducing soil-borne inoculum.

Chilli wilt, caused by either Fusarium wilt or bacterial wilt, is a significant disease affecting chilli crops. Symptoms include yellowing and wilting of lower leaves, which can progress to the entire plant collapsing. When the stem is cut, the vascular tissue turns brown, and a milky ooze may appear in bacterial wilt. Fruits may also show soft rot. To treat the disease, infected plants along with surrounding soil should be removed and destroyed. Disease-free, certified seedlings should be used, and treated with appropriate fungicides or bio-agents before planting. It is also essential to avoid reusing infected soil for chilli.

To prevent chilli wilt, crop rotation with non-solanaceous crops should be practiced. Continuous chilli or other solanaceous crops in the same field should be avoided. Good drainage and avoidance of waterlogging are also crucial. Certified seedlings should be used, and farm-yard manure from infected sources should be avoided.

Cercospora leaf spot, caused by Cercospora capsici, is another disease affecting chilli crops. Symptoms include small, round to irregular lesions on leaves with dark brown margins and gray or pale centers. As the disease progresses, spots may coalesce, causing yellowing, drying, and premature leaf drop. Severe infection can reduce fruit set and yield. To treat the disease, healthy, disease-free seedlings should be used, and balanced fertilization maintained. Mancozeb or similar broad-spectrum fungicides should be sprayed at the first sign of leaf spots, and repeated 1-2 times at 10-day intervals under humid conditions.

To prevent Cercospora leaf spot, chilli should be rotated with non-host crops. Dense planting and overhead irrigation, which prolong leaf wetness, should be avoided. Infected leaves and crop residues should be removed after harvest, and field sanitation maintained.

Chilli mosaic or leaf curl viruses, such as Chilli Veinal Mottle and Leaf Curl, can also affect chilli crops. Symptoms include leaves showing mosaic-like light and dark green patches, mottling, curling, and stunting. Plants may remain bushy with reduced flowering and fruiting, and fruits are small, misshapen, and poorly coloured, reducing market value. There is no chemical cure for the virus, so infected plants should be removed and destroyed immediately. Resistant or tolerant varieties should be used where available, and aphid and whitefly vectors controlled with approved insecticides at recommended doses.

To prevent chilli mosaic or leaf curl viruses, virus-free seedlings should be used, and planting in high-whitefly/aphid pressure areas without protection should be avoided. Field sanitation and removal of weed hosts such as Datura and Sida are also essential.



To manage thrips infestation in chilli crops, yellow sticky traps or insect-net houses can be used to reduce vector pressure. Thrips scrape and feed on leaves, flowers, and young fruits, causing silvering, browning, curling, and distortion. Severe infestation leads to flower drop, poor fruit set, and reduced yield and quality. Systemic insecticides such as Imidacloprid, Acetamiprid, or Spinosad should be used at label-recommended doses when thrips first appear. In IPM-oriented systems, neem-based or other bio-pesticides can be used in combination with blue or yellow sticky traps for monitoring and suppression. Regular scouting on leaves and flowers is essential, and spraying should be done at the first sign of infestation, repeating at 7-10-day intervals under heavy pressure. Good coverage of undersides of leaves and tender shoots is also crucial. Dense planting and excessive nitrogen should be avoided as they favour thrips. Encouraging natural enemies such as predatory thrips, lacewings, and lady beetles by reducing broad-spectrum sprays is also beneficial. Maintaining field sanitation and removing weed hosts can also help prevent thrips infestation.

Aphids can also infest chilli crops, causing cluster formation on undersides of leaves and tender shoots, sucking sap and causing yellowing, curling, and stunted growth. Honeydew secretion leads to sooty mould on leaves and fruits, reducing photosynthesis and market quality. Aphids may also transmit viral diseases. Systemic insecticides such as Imidacloprid, Acetamiprid, or Dimethoate should be sprayed at label-recommended doses when aphids are first observed. In organic or IPM systems, neem-based sprays, azadirachtin, or pyrethrin-like bio-pesticides can be used where effective. Spraying should start at early colonization and repeated at 7-10-day intervals if needed. Combining with yellow sticky traps or biological control agents can help monitor and reduce populations. Using resistant or tolerant varieties where available, maintaining field sanitation, and removing alternate weed hosts can also help prevent aphid infestation. Encouraging natural enemies by reducing harsh insecticides is also beneficial.

Chilli Leaf Curl Virus (ChiLCV) is a significant disease affecting chilli crops. Leaves show severe upward curling, twisting, and stunting, often with a puckered appearance. Plants remain bushy and short, with reduced branching and poor flowering. Fruits are small, distorted, and may be few in number, leading to heavy yield loss. The virus is caused by Chilli leaf curl virus (ChiLCV), a begomovirus transmitted by whitefly (Bemisia tabaci). There is no chemical cure for the virus, and management strategies focus on preventing its spread.


To manage Chilli Mosaic Virus (CMV, PVY-type), it is essential to take preventive measures. Remove and destroy infected plants immediately to reduce the spread of the virus. Use virus-free, certified seedlings and avoid transferring infected plant material. Maintain field sanitation and remove weed hosts such as Datura, Sida, and other solanaceous weeds. Yellow sticky traps and insect-net houses or row covers can also be used to reduce whitefly population. Additionally, use resistant or tolerant varieties where available and avoid planting in high-whitefly-pressure areas without protection. Control whitefly with approved insecticides such as Imidacloprid, Acetamiprid, or Spinosad at recommended doses, starting early in the crop cycle.

Infected plants with Chilli Mosaic Virus may show mosaic-like light and dark green patches, mottling, yellow vein patterns, and distortion. They may be stunted, with reduced flowering and fruiting, and fruits may be small, misshapen, and poorly coloured, reducing marketability. The virus is caused by mosaic-type viruses such as Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) or Potato virus Y (PVY), transmitted by aphids and contaminated tools or seed.

To manage the virus, remove and destroy infected plants as early as possible. Use resistant or tolerant varieties where available and practice strict nursery and field hygiene. Control aphid vectors with systemic insecticides such as Imidacloprid or Acetamiprid at recommended doses. It is also crucial to use virus-free seedlings and avoid reusing tools or scissors without cleaning. Maintain field sanitation and remove alternative weed hosts. Encourage natural enemies and avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm predators.

Black Flower Thrips / Leaf Thrips (Scirtothrips dorsalis, Thrips parvispinus) can cause significant damage to chilli crops. Thrips feed on leaves, flowers, and young fruits, causing silvering, browning, curling, and distortion. Flowers may drop, fruits may be small and misshapen, and yield is reduced. To manage this pest, use resistant or tolerant varieties where available and practice strict nursery and field hygiene. Control thrips with approved insecticides at recommended doses, and maintain field sanitation to reduce the population of thrips.


In severe cases of infestation, the entire plant may appear burnt and stunted. To manage thrips, use systemic insecticides such as Imidacloprid, Acetamiprid, or Spinosad at label-recommended doses when the pests are first observed. In integrated pest management (IPM)-oriented systems, neem-based or other bio-pesticides can be used in combination with blue or yellow sticky traps to monitor and reduce thrips populations. Regular scouting on leaves, flowers, and fruit clusters is essential, and spraying at the first sign of infestation is crucial. Repeated spraying at 7-10-day intervals under heavy pressure, ensuring good coverage of the undersides of leaves and tender shoots, can help control the infestation.

To prevent thrips infestation, avoid dense planting and excessive nitrogen, which can favour the pests. Encouraging natural enemies such as predatory thrips, lacewings, and lady beetles by reducing harsh insecticides can also help. Maintaining field sanitation and removing weed hosts is essential in preventing the spread of thrips.

Aphids cluster on the undersides of leaves and young shoots of chilli plants, sucking sap and causing yellowing, curling, and stunted growth. Honeydew secretion leads to sooty mould on leaves and fruits, reducing photosynthesis and market quality. Aphids may also transmit viral diseases such as mosaic and leaf curl. To manage aphids, use systemic insecticides such as Imidacloprid, Acetamiprid, or Dimethoate at label-recommended doses when the pests first appear. In organic or IPM systems, neem-based sprays, azadirachtin, or pyrethrin-like bio-pesticides can be used where effective. Regular spraying at early colonization and repeated at 7-10-day intervals if needed can help control the infestation.

Combining spraying with yellow sticky traps or biological control agents can also monitor and reduce aphid populations. To prevent aphid infestation, use resistant or tolerant varieties where available. Maintaining field sanitation and removing alternate weed hosts is essential in preventing the spread of aphids. Encouraging natural enemies by reducing broad-spectrum sprays can also help.

Whiteflies feed on the undersides of chilli leaves, causing yellowing, stunting, and reduced vigour. They secrete honeydew, leading to sooty mould growth on leaves and fruits. To manage whiteflies, use systemic insecticides such as Imidacloprid, Acetamiprid, or Dimethoate at label-recommended doses when the pests are first observed. In IPM-oriented systems, neem-based or other bio-pesticides can be used in combination with blue or yellow sticky traps to monitor and reduce whitefly populations. Regular scouting and spraying at the first sign of infestation, combined with repeated spraying at 7-10-day intervals under heavy pressure, can help control the infestation.


Whiteflies also transmit viral diseases such as leaf curl and mosaic-type viruses of chilli. To manage whitefly populations, it is recommended to use systemic insecticides like Imidacloprid, Acetamiprid, or other approved products at label-recommended doses when adults are first observed. These insecticides can be combined with neem-based or bio-pesticides and used in conjunction with yellow sticky traps for monitoring and suppression.

Effective management of whitefly populations involves starting spraying at low-population stages and repeating at 7-10-day intervals if needed. Spot-sprays are preferred over blanket treatment where possible to minimize unnecessary chemical use. This approach helps to reduce the risk of developing pesticide-resistant whitefly populations.

Preventing whitefly infestations is also crucial. This can be achieved by using resistant or tolerant varieties of chilli where available. Additionally, controlling weed hosts and removing alternate solanaceous weeds can help to reduce the risk of whitefly infestations. Promoting natural enemies and reducing harsh insecticide use can also help to preserve parasitoids and predators that prey on whiteflies, creating a more balanced ecosystem.
