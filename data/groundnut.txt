Collar Rot, caused by Aspergillus niger, is a prevalent disease in almost all groundnut-growing states, resulting in significant losses ranging from 28 to 50% in terms of plant mortality. The disease manifests itself through various symptoms, including pre-emergence rotting of seeds, rotting of hypocotyl, post-emergence seedling blight, and rapid wilting of the entire plant or its branches. The collar region of affected plants becomes shredded and dark brown. Soil-borne inoculum is the primary source of infection, and the pathogen can tolerate low soil moisture up to 16%. The fungus develops best at temperatures between 31 and 35°C.

To manage Collar Rot, it is essential to follow crop rotation with wheat and gram or mixed cropping with moth bean. Deep sowing should be avoided, and the soil application of neem cake or castor cake at 500 kg per hectare can be beneficial. Using resistant or tolerant varieties is also recommended. Seed treatment with Trichoderma harzianum or T. viride at 10 g per kilogram of seeds and their soil application can help control the disease. Additionally, seed treatment with carbendazim at 1-2 g per kilogram of seeds or mancozeb at 2 g per kilogram of seeds can be effective.

Afla-root or Yellow Mold, caused by Aspergillus flavus, is another prevalent disease in almost all groundnut-growing states. The fungus is commonly found in the seed of both rotten and apparently healthy pods of groundnut. It first appears on cotyledons after the emergence of seedlings, causing stunted growth, reduced leaf size, and symptoms of vein clearing and chlorosis on the leaflets. Infected plants lack a secondary root system, a condition known as "aflaroot." Yellow-green Aspergillus colonies develop on over-mature and damaged seeds and pods. Soil-borne inoculum is the primary source of infection, and infected seeds and spores contaminated on the surface of seeds act as a source of inoculums. The pathogen can tolerate low soil moisture, and the fungus develops best at temperatures between 25 and 35°C.

To manage Afla-root or Yellow Mold, it is essential to follow a crop rotation, such as cereal-cereal-groundnut. Sowing good quality and disease-free seed or certified seeds from a seed certification agency is also crucial. Avoiding damage to the seed testa during shelling, sowing, and deep placement of seed at sowing can help prevent the disease. Seed treatment with thiram or carbendazim at 4 g per kilogram of seeds can be effective in controlling the disease.

Stem Rot, caused by Sclerotium rolfsii, is a severe disease in all groundnut-growing states, particularly in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Orissa, and Tamil Nadu. The pathogen has a wide host range, and the disease is very severe in these regions.



Latur, Raichur, Dharwad, Junagadh, and Hanumangarh have been identified as hot spots for the disease, which can cause significant yield losses of up to 27% or more. Indirect losses such as reduction in dry weight and oil content have also been reported. The disease is characterized by initial symptoms of partial or complete wilting of the stem or branches in contact with the infected soil, with leaves turning brown and remaining attached to the plant. White mycelial growth around the infected stem is visible, and later stages show abundant sclerotia development, along with symptoms such as infection of pegs, pod rot, and leaf blight.

The pathogen survives in the soil for more than four years and has a wide host range. Crop residues, soil moisture to the extent of 40 to 50% of the water-holding capacity, and temperatures between 29 to 32°C during the day and 25°C at night favor the pathogen infection and disease development. Effective disease management involves deep burial of surface organic matter and crop debris by plowing it to a depth of 8-10 inches. Crop rotation with cotton, wheat, maize, jowar, onion, and garlic can also help manage the disease. Using tolerant varieties and seed treatment with Trichoderma viride or Trichoderma harzianium can be beneficial. Additionally, soil application of castor cake or neem cake or mustard cake enriched with Trichoderma viride or Trichoderma harzianium can help control the disease. Seed treatment with captan can also effectively reduce stem rot incidences.

Dry root rot or charcoal rot is a sporadic disease occurrence in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra. The pathogen causes severe seedling mortality, resulting in a patchy crop stand and reduced optimum plant population. Symptoms include water-soaked necrotic spots on the stem just above the ground level, which can girdle the stem and cause wilting. The infected stem portion becomes shredded, with sclerotia development turning black and sooty in appearance. Roots, pegs, and pods also rot and are covered with sclerotia, and infected kernels turn black. The pathogen has a wide host range and is a facultative saprophyte and soil dweller. Infected soil, plant debris, and pods serve as sources of inoculum. The optimum temperature for seedling infection is between 29 to 35°C, and for pods invasion is between 26 and 32°C.



Sclerotia of the disease-causing fungus are disseminated through various means, including plant debris, soil, infected pods, shell, and kernel. To manage the disease effectively, it is essential to avoid damaging pods and kernels. Seed treatment with Trichoderma polysporum, T. viride, or T. harzianum at a rate of 10 grams per kilogram of seeds, or carbendazim at 2-3 grams per kilogram of seeds, or captafol or thiram at 3 grams per kilogram of seeds can significantly reduce the incidence of root rot.

Early Leaf Spot, caused by Cercospora arachidicola, is a widespread disease affecting groundnut crops in northern, southern, and central growing states. The disease results in significant yield losses, ranging from 15 to 59 percent, and also affects the quality of the fodder. Symptoms of the disease typically appear 30 days after sowing, with minute circular to subcircular chlorotic spots developing on the upper surface of the leaf, which later turn brown and are surrounded by a yellow halo. The corresponding lower surface of the leaf shows dark brown color due to abundant sporulation, and severely infected leaves may drop off prematurely. The lesion may extend to the stem and branches.

The pathogen survives through conidia on affected plant debris in the soil or on infected groundnut shell. It also survives from one season to another on volunteer groundnut plants. Favorable conditions for the disease include temperatures between 25 and 30 degrees Celsius, prolonged leaf wetness hours, and high relative humidity (greater than 80 percent). To manage the disease, it is essential to remove volunteer groundnut plants, deep burying of crop residues, and growing of tolerant varieties. Intercropping pearl millet or sorghum with groundnut at a ratio of 1:3 or 1:5 can also help reduce the disease severity. Foliar application of carbendazim (0.05%) + mancozeb (0.2%) or difenoconazole 25EC 1 ml per liter of spray solution or tebuconazole 25 EC at 1.5 ml per liter of spray solution at 2-3 weeks interval, 2 or 3 times from the initiation of the disease can effectively reduce the early leaf spot severity.

Late Leaf Spot, caused by Phaeoisariopsis personata, is a common disease affecting groundnut crops worldwide, resulting in yield losses ranging from 15 to 59 percent. Besides the losses in pod and kernel yield, the fodder quality is also adversely affected. Symptoms of the disease typically appear on 60 days old crop to till harvesting, with minute chlorotic spots developing on the upper surface of the leaf, which later turn into irregular dark brown spots. The corresponding lower surface of the leaf shows dark brown to black color due to abundant sporulation, and several lesions may coalesce, causing infected leaves to drop off prematurely.



Oblong lesions can be observed on the stem and branches of groundnut plants, while leaf spots can be seen on standing crops in the field. Late leaf spot is a significant disease affecting groundnut, and its pathogen survives through conidia on affected plant debris in the soil or on infected groundnut shells, as well as from one season to another on volunteer groundnut plants. The disease thrives in temperatures between 25 and 30 degrees Celsius, prolonged leaf wetness hours, and high relative humidity above 80%.

To manage late leaf spot, it is essential to remove volunteer groundnut plants and deeply bury crop residues. Growing resistant or tolerant varieties of groundnut can also help mitigate the disease. Intercropping pearl millet or sorghum with groundnut can be an effective strategy, and foliar application of specific fungicides such as carbendazim, mancozeb, difenoconazole, or tebuconazole at regular intervals can significantly reduce the disease severity.

Rust, caused by the pathogen Puccinia arachidis, is a widespread disease affecting groundnut crops, particularly in the southern states. The disease can cause significant yield losses, ranging from 10 to 52%, and also reduces seed size and oil content of groundnut. Initially, chlorotic spots develop on the upper surface of the leaf, followed by the appearance of orange-colored pustules on the lower surface, which later turn brown. Severely infected leaves can become necrotic and desiccate but remain attached to the plant. The disease can also affect the stem, petiole, and flower, leading to shriveled and small kennels in affected plants.

The rust pathogen survives as urediniospores and on self-sown (volunteer) groundnut plants infected by rust. The disease thrives in temperatures around 20 degrees Celsius, prolonged leaf wetness hours, and high humidity.


The spread of disease within crops is facilitated by wind movement, rain splash, and insects. To manage the disease effectively, it is essential to destroy volunteer groundnut plants, as they can act as primary inoculums. Early sowing, ideally in the first fortnight of June, can also help avoid the disease. Intercropping with pearl millet or sorghum at a ratio of 1:3 can be beneficial. Additionally, using resistant or tolerant varieties of groundnut can significantly reduce disease severity. Foliar application of aqueous neem leaf extract, neem seed kernel extract, mancozeb, chlorothalonil, or triodimefon can also help reduce disease severity.

Alternaria leaf blight, caused by Alternaria tenuissima, has been a severe issue on summer groundnut in the past four years, resulting in significant losses in pod and fodder yield. The disease initially manifests as light to dark brown 'V' shaped spots on the apical portions of leaflets, which later extend to the midrib and the entire leaf, causing a blighted appearance. In the later stages, blighted leaves curl inward and become brittle, with adjacent lesions joining together to give the leaf a ragged appearance. The disease is facilitated by wind movement, insects, and favourable conditions such as temperatures above 20°C, prolonged leaf wetness hours, and high humidity.

To manage Alternaria leaf blight, it is crucial to avoid growing susceptible cultivars and remove volunteer crops. This can help prevent the spread of the disease within the crop. Furthermore, using resistant or tolerant varieties of groundnut can also help reduce disease severity.

Peanut bud necrosis, caused by the peanut bud necrosis virus, is a widespread issue in several hot spot locations, including Jagtiyal, Hyderabad, Latur, Tikamgarh, Raichur, and Mainpuri. The disease can cause significant yield losses, ranging from 30% to 90%. The characteristic symptoms of the disease include axillary shoot proliferation, severe leaf deformity, and necrosis of the terminal and axillary buds. The pathogen has a wide host range and can survive on ornamentals, weeds, and crop plants. Temperature above 30°C and wind speed of 10km/h favour the migration of thrips, which are the primary vectors of the disease. The thrips population increases rapidly in late August and September, making it essential to manage the disease effectively during this period.


The population of thrips builds up again during January and February, which severely affects the rabi season crop. To manage the disease effectively, it is recommended to grow tolerant varieties of the crop. In central India, early sowing in mid to late June is advisable, while in North India, late sowing in July is preferred. Closer spacing of 20 or 22.5 x 7.5 or 10 cm can also help in reducing the movement of thrips. Intercropping with pearlmillet, sorghum, or maize at a ratio of 1:3 with groundnut can also be an effective strategy. Additionally, seed treatment with imidacloprid and foliar application of monocrotophos, imidacloprid, acetamiprid, or thiamethoxam can help in controlling the disease.

Peanut Stem Necrosis Virus is a significant disease affecting groundnut crops in certain districts of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. The disease is characterized by necrosis of the stem and terminal leaflets, followed by the death of the plant. The virus and its vector, thrips, have a wide host range, including Parthenium, cowpea, black gram, and marigold. To manage this disease, it is essential to avoid monocropping of groundnut and control weeds. Growing tolerant varieties and adopting closer spacing of 20 or 22.5 x 7.5 or 10 cm can also help in reducing the incidence of the disease. Intercropping with redgram and bajra or redgram and castor, or alternate cropping of sorghum, bajra, maize, castor, sesamum with groundnut in endemic areas, at least once in three years, can also be an effective strategy. Seed treatment with imidacloprid and foliar application of monocrotophos, imidacloprid, acetamiprid, or thiamethoxam can also help in controlling the disease.


To manage pests and diseases effectively in groundnut, it is essential to adopt integrated pest and disease management practices. Deep ploughing to a depth of 8-10 inches during summer can help reduce pests and inoculum of pathogens in the soil. Additionally, removing volunteer groundnut plants, crop debris, and weeds is crucial to prevent the buildup of disease-causing organisms.

Crop rotation is another effective strategy to reduce the inoculum of Sclerotium rolfsii in the soil. Groundnut can be rotated with crops like cotton, wheat, maize, sorghum, onion, and garlic, or mixed cropping with moth bean. Crop rotation with cereals can also help reduce the root-knot nematode population in the soil.

To reduce tobacco caterpillar damage, growing 3-4 rows of pearl-millet as a border crop and castor as a trap crop (250 g seeds/ha mixed with groundnut seeds) is recommended. Intercropping with pearl-millet or maize can also reduce the movement of thrips and bud necrosis disease. Groundnut inter-cropping with pearl-millet or sorghum or maize or pigeonpea can reduce the severity of leaf spots and rust, while inter-cropping with soybean can reduce leafminer, thrips, and leafhoppers.

In areas where nematode disease is endemic, applying neem/castor cakes @ 1 t/ha seven days prior to sowing or in combination with carbosulfan 25 DS @ 3% a.i. (w/w) as seed treatment can help reduce nematode population. Alternatively, applying carbofuran 3 G @ 1-2 kg a.i./ha at the time of sowing can also be effective.

To prevent disease incidence, it is recommended to use insect and disease-resistant or tolerant varieties, and certified quality seeds that are free from diseases or any insect damage. Sowing the crop early in the season can also help avoid damage by leafminer, white grubs, and collar rot. Avoid deep sowing to prevent collar rot disease.

Seed treatment with commercial formulations of Trichoderma harzianum or T. viride @ 10 g/kg seeds, tebuconazole 2 DS @ 1.5 g/kg seeds, carbendazim @ 2 g/kg seeds, or mancozeb @ 3-4 g/kg seeds can help prevent seed and soil-borne diseases. Soil application of Trichoderma spp. @ 4 kg enriched in 250 kg FYM or 200 kg castor cake can also be effective in preventing soil-borne diseases.



For effective monitoring of moth activity, install 1-2 light traps per hectare and pheromone traps at a density of 10 traps per hectare for tobacco caterpillar and gram pod borer, and 25 traps per hectare for leafminer. It is also essential to collect and destroy egg masses, gregarious larvae, and adults of pests such as tobacco caterpillar, red hairy caterpillars, and white grub. Conserve the natural enemies of these pests, including coccinellids, spiders, hymenopteran and dipteran parasitoids.

To manage these pests, release adults of Trichogramma chilonis or Telenomus remus at a rate of 50,000 per hectare, two times at 7-10 days interval, followed by the release of Bracon hebetor at a rate of 5,000 per hectare, two times at 7-10 days interval, against leafminer and defoliators. Additionally, spray commercial formulations of nuclear polyhedrosis viruses (NPV-Spodoptera and NPV-Helicoverpa) at a concentration of 0.4 ml/L for the management of tobacco caterpillar and gram pod borer, and granulosis virus (GV-Amsacta) at a concentration of 0.3 ml/L for red hairy caterpillars.

For the control of defoliator pests, spray entomopathogenic bacteria, Bacillus thuringiensis at a concentration of 2 g/L, and entomopathogenic fungus like Nomuraea rileyi and Beauveria bassiana at a concentration of 2 g/L. For sucking pests, spray Verticillium lecanii at a concentration of 5 g/L. Neem oil can also be sprayed at a concentration of 5 ml/L, along with suitable surfactants like soap powder or neem seed kernel extract, to manage defoliators and reduce the severity of leaf spots and rust.

Fungicides should be applied as needed for the management of leaf spots and rust. Propiconazole 25 EC, hexaconazole 5 EC, or tebuconazole 25.9 EC can be sprayed at a concentration of 1 ml/L. For the control of sucking pests like thrips and leafhoppers, apply dimethoate 30 EC, monocrotophos 36 SL, imidacloprid 17.8 SL, thiacloprid 480 SC, thiamethoxam 25 WG, or acetamiprid 20 SP at a recommended concentration between 25 and 30 days after sowing.

For the management of defoliator pests like tobacco caterpillar and gram pod borer, apply chlorpyriphos 20 EC, quinalphos 25 EC, profenofos 50 EC, flubendiamide 480 SC, or novaluron 10 EC at a recommended concentration. For leafminer management, apply profenofos 50 EC, spinosad 45 SC, flubendiamide 480 SC, or quinalphos 25 EC at a recommended concentration.

To manage red hairy caterpillar, dig furrow trenches around the field and dust with carbaryl 50 WP at a concentration of 5%. For tobacco caterpillar management, spread the poison bait consisting of rice bran 12.5 kg, molasses/jaggery 2.5 kg, and carbaryl 50 WP 1.25 kg in the field during the evening hours. When storing groundnut pods in warehouses or godowns, spray malathion 50 EC at a concentration of 5.0 ml/L or deltamethrin 2.5 SC at 0.5 ml/L on the walls, floor, and roof before storage. Additionally, use aluminium phosphide 56% at a rate of 1 pouch (10g) per ton of pods to manage bruchids, specifically Caryedon serratus.

In groundnut pest management, it is recommended to adopt practices such as soil solarization, deep tillage, and clean cultivation to keep the field free from weeds and crop debris. Seed treatment, crop rotation, and intercropping practices can also be beneficial. Fertilizers should be applied on a need basis, and surveillance and monitoring of the pest should be conducted to inform need-based management practices. Whenever possible, prefer bio-pesticides over synthetic pesticides, and conserve natural enemies of pests by growing refuge crops. Pesticides, including bio-pesticides, should be applied during the morning and evening hours of the day. Infected plants should be removed and destroyed, particularly those affected by groundnut bud necrosis disease.

To avoid pest management issues, it is essential to avoid depositing soil particles on germinated plants during inter-cultural operations. Overdosing with nitrogen fertilizers should be avoided, as this can increase plant growth and susceptibility to insect-pests and diseases. Indiscriminate use of pesticides should be avoided, and spurious pesticides should not be used. Pesticides should not be sprayed during hot sunny hours or against the direction of wind. Broad-spectrum pesticides should also be avoided. Furthermore, groundnut bud necrosis affected plants should not be kept in the field.


When storing produce, it is crucial to maintain a moisture level below 9% to prevent spoilage and damage. Additionally, it is essential to store produce in clean and infestation-free storage structures or godowns, and avoid using infested godowns or gunny bags.

For groundnut cultivation in Tamil Nadu, the ideal sowing time varies depending on the irrigation method. For irrigated areas, the best sowing times are during Chithiraipattam (April-May), Margazhipattam (December-January), and Thaippattam (January-February). In rainfed areas, the suitable sowing times are Anippattam (June-July), Adippattam (July-August), Purattasipattam (September-October), Ayppasipattam (October-November), and Karthigaipattam (November-December).

Several groundnut varieties are suitable for cultivation in Tamil Nadu, including Co 6, Co 7 TMV 2, TMV 7, TMVGn 13, TMV 14, VRI 2, VRI 6, VRI 7, VRI 8, and ALR 3. The recommended seed rate is 125 kg per hectare, or 175 kg per hectare of kernels for bold seeded varieties. The optimal spacing for groundnut cultivation is 30 x 10 cm, although 15 x 15 cm spacing may be used in areas where groundnut ring mosaic (bud necrosis) is prevalent.

To ensure the health and productivity of groundnut seeds, it is essential to apply proper seed treatment. This can be achieved by treating the seeds with Thiram or Mancozeb at 4 g/kg of seed, or Carboxin or Carbendazim at 2 g/kg of seed. Alternatively, Trichoderma viride at 4 g/kg seed or Pseudomonas fluorescens at 10 g/kg seed can be used. Additionally, treating the seeds with 3 packets (600 g) per hectare of Rhizobial culture TNAU14 is recommended.


If the seed treatment is not carried out, apply 10 packets of fungicide, insecticide, and Rhizobium per hectare, mixed with 25 kilograms of farm yard manure and 25 kilograms of soil before sowing. 

For weed management, fluchloralin at 2.0 liters per hectare should be applied to the soil and incorporated followed by a light irrigation before sowing. Pendimethalin at 3.3 liters per hectare should be applied on the third day after sowing. Imazethapyr at 750 milliliters per hectare should be sprayed 20-30 days after sowing based on weed density. If no herbicide is applied, two hand hoeing and weeding should be given on the 20th and 40th day after sowing. Alternatively, PE Oxyfluorfen at 200 grams per hectare can be applied on the third day after sowing followed by one hand weeding on the 40-45th day after sowing. Another option is to apply PE Oxadiazon at 0.8 kilograms per hectare followed by one earthing up using hoes or a star type weeder. PE Metalachlor at 1.0 kilogram per hectare can also be applied followed by one hand weeding on the 40th day after sowing.

Major pests and diseases affecting groundnut in Tamil Nadu include early leaf spot caused by Cercospora arachidicola, late leaf spot caused by Phaeoisariopsis personatum, rust caused by Puccinia arachidis, stem rot caused by Sclerotium rolfsii, and bud necrosis caused by Peanut bud necrosis virus. To manage early leaf spot, carbendazim at 500 grams per hectare, mancozeb at 1000 grams per hectare, or chlorothalonil at 1000 grams per hectare can be sprayed. For late leaf spot, intercropping with pearl millet or sorghum at a ratio of 1:3 or crop rotation with cereals can be effective. Deep burying of crop residues in the soil and removal of volunteer groundnut plants can also help. Alternatively, carbendazim at 0.1%, mancozeb at 0.2%, or chlorothalonil at 0.2% can be sprayed. To manage rust, mancozeb at 1000 grams per hectare, chlorothalonil at 1000 grams per hectare, wettable sulphur at 2500 grams per hectare, or tridemorph at 500 milliliters per hectare can be sprayed. If necessary, the spray can be repeated 15 days later. For stem rot, seed treatment with Trichoderma viride at 4 grams per kilogram of seed can be effective. Soil application of Trichoderma viride at 2.5 kilograms per hectare, mixed with 50 kilograms of organic manures, can also help. Alternatively, seed treatment with 3 grams of Thiram and carbendazim can be used. Removal or burial of crop residues can also help manage stem rot. To manage bud necrosis, a close spacing of 15 x 15 centimeters can be adopted. Infected plants should be removed up to 6 weeks after sowing. For Alternaria leaf disease, caused by Alternaria arachidis and A. tenuissima, foliar application of mancozeb at 0.3%, copper oxychloride at 0.3%, or carbendazim at 0.1% can be effective. Red hairy caterpillars, Amsacta albistriga and A. moorei, can be managed by adopting integrated pest management practices.



Before the onset of summer rains, it is essential to remove and destroy the pupae from field bunds and shady spots to prevent infestation. Additionally, setting up light traps at a rate of 3 to 4 per hectare can help in controlling the population. It is also crucial to collect and destroy egg masses found in the cropped area to prevent larvae from hatching. To prevent the migration of larvae, a trench 30 cm deep and 25 cm wide with perpendicular sides should be dug around the infested fields. For young caterpillars, apply Phosalone 35 EC at a rate of 750 ml per hectare in 375 liters of water or Dichlorvos 76 EC at a rate of 627 ml per hectare at 25 kg per hectare.

For Groundnut leaf miner, Aproaerema modicella, setting up light traps at a rate of 12 per hectare is recommended. In case of infestation, apply Dimethiate 30 EC at a rate of 660 ml per hectare, Malathion 50 EC at a rate of 1.25 liters per hectare, or Methyl demeton 25% EC at a rate of 1000 ml per hectare.

The Pod borer, Anisolabis stalli, can be controlled by applying Malathion 5 D at a rate of 25 kg per hectare or Carbofuran 3% CG at a rate of 50 kg per hectare at 40 days after sowing.

The Groundnut crop typically takes 100 to 110 days to mature. Harvesting is done when 80% of the pods are matured, and the crop is harvested by digging the pods or by pulling the plants from the field. It is essential to harvest the crop when the seed moisture content is between 18 to 20 percent.

Recommended varieties for Tamil Nadu include Tamil Nadu GJG-32, GJG-33, VRI 8, Phule Chaitanya, Phule Dhani, BSR 2, KDG-128, KDG-123, ALG-06-320, TMV-13, VRI-6, VRI-7, AK-265, Ajeya, ICGV00348, ICGV-00350, Vijetha, and GG-16.

Bacterial Leaf Spot is caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv.


In Tamil Nadu, arachidis is an important crop that is susceptible to various diseases, particularly during humid and rainy conditions, especially in irrigated groundnut belts. One of the diseases that affects arachidis is characterized by small water-soaked spots on leaves that become dark brown to black with a yellow halo. These spots may merge, causing blighting, and severe infection can lead to premature leaf drop. To manage this disease, it is essential to use disease-free certified seeds, avoid overhead irrigation, practice crop rotation, and spray copper oxychloride at the initial symptom appearance. Additionally, removing infected crop residues after harvest is crucial to prevent the spread of the disease.

Arachidis is also affected by anthracnose, a disease caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. This disease is seen in warm and humid zones and can affect both the foliage and pods of the crop. The symptoms of anthracnose include dark brown circular lesions on leaves and stems, sunken lesions on pods, and twig dieback in severe cases. Reduced pod development is also a common outcome of this disease. To manage anthracnose, field sanitation and removal of infected debris are essential, along with crop rotation with non-host crops, seed treatment with carbendazim, and foliar spray of mancozeb during the early disease stage.

Another significant disease affecting arachidis in Tamil Nadu is root knot nematode, caused by Meloidogyne arenaria. This disease is common in sandy soils and irrigated fields, where it causes swollen root galls, a poor root system, stunted growth, yellowing leaves, and reduced pod formation. To manage root knot nematode, crop rotation with cereals, summer deep ploughing, application of neem cake, and use of resistant or tolerant varieties are recommended. Soil solarization before sowing is also an effective method to control this disease.

Peanut clump virus (PCV) is another disease that affects arachidis in localized sandy soils and is transmitted by soil fungus. The symptoms of PCV include severe stunting, dark green leaves, shortened internodes, and reduced pod yield. To manage PCV, crop rotation, deep ploughing, and avoiding continuous monocropping are essential. Using tolerant varieties is also recommended to prevent the spread of this disease.
