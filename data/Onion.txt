To cultivate onions successfully, it is essential to grow them in well-drained, friable loam to sandy loam soils with a pH around 6.0-7.5. Avoid highly acidic, saline, or alkali soils and continuous waterlogging, as these conditions can lead to poor growth and reduced yields. Before planting, prepare the land by repeated ploughing and harrowing to achieve a fine tilth. In heavy soils, consider raising raised beds or ridges to improve drainage.

When sowing onion seeds, use about 8-10 kg per hectare. You can either sow in nursery beds and transplant 40-45-day-old seedlings at a spacing of 15x10 cm, or direct-sow where practiced, ensuring proper stand. Apply balanced NPK nutrition, often in the range of 100-120 kg N, 40-60 kg P, and 60-80 kg K per hectare, split over time. This can be supplemented with organic manure or compost where soils are poor.

Maintain regular, light irrigation, especially in the early stages and at bulb-initiation, to prevent waterlogging and long-term dry stress. Avoid excessive nitrogen application, especially late in the season, as this can increase susceptibility to diseases and affect bulb quality. Practice proper weeding and light earthing-up where needed to keep the soil loose and support root development.

To reduce the build-up of soil-borne diseases and nematodes, rotate onion with non-allium and non-bulb crops, such as cereals or legumes. Avoid growing onions in poorly drained or waterlogged fields, and do not plant in highly acidic, saline, or alkali soils without proper correction and drainage. It is also essential to monitor the crop regularly for early signs of major diseases, such as purple blotch, downy mildew, or white rot, and pests like thrips or aphids, and take prompt action to prevent losses.

Purple blotch, caused by Alternaria porri, is a common disease that can affect onion crops. Symptoms include purple or brown elongated lesions with dark margins on leaves, often with a purple or purplish-brown center. As the disease progresses, lesions enlarge, leaves dry up from tips downward, and plants may lodge or die, reducing bulb size and yield. To manage this disease, use healthy, disease-free seed and avoid continuous onion cropping. Spray broad-spectrum fungicides, such as Mancozeb or Chlorothalonil, at a 0.2-0.3% solution starting about 20 days after planting, and repeat 2-3 times at 10-14-day intervals in high-humidity weather. Prevention is key, and rotating onion with non-host crops can help reduce the risk of disease.


To manage Downy Mildew in onion crops, it is essential to avoid dense planting and overhead irrigation, which can lead to prolonged leaf wetness. This can be achieved by using drip irrigation and proper spacing. Additionally, maintaining field sanitation is crucial by removing and destroying infected plant debris. When selecting onion varieties, opt for relatively resistant or tolerant types where available. If necessary, apply protective fungicides such as Mancozeb at a 0.2-0.3% solution, starting 20 days after planting, and repeat 2-3 times at 10-14-day intervals in cool, wet periods.

To prevent White Rot in onion crops, it is vital to avoid prolonged leaf wetness by using drip irrigation and proper spacing. Rotate onion with non-allium crops to break the disease cycle. After harvest, remove and destroy heavily infected plants and debris to prevent the spread of the disease. In severely affected fields, it is recommended to avoid planting onion for several years.

Fusarium Basal Rot in onion crops can be managed by removing and destroying infected plants and bulbs. Avoid replanting onion in infested soil for several seasons. To prevent the disease, use disease-free seedlings and sets, and rotate onion with non-host crops. Maintain proper drainage and avoid excessive nitrogen. Practice field sanitation and avoid contaminated tools or soil movement.

Onion Thrips can be a significant pest in onion crops, causing damage to leaves. Thrips scrape and feed on leaves, resulting in silvering, browning, and silvery-white streaks on the upper surface. To manage this pest, maintain proper field sanitation and avoid contaminated tools or soil movement.


Leaves may become twisted, stunted, and show reduced photosynthesis, leading to poor bulb development and reduced yield. To manage thrips, pesticides such as Dimethoate 30 EC or Fipronil 80 WG can be sprayed at the recommended dose, typically 0.05-0.08% solution, or 750 ml/ha. In integrated pest management systems, Spinosad, Imidacloprid, or bio-pesticides can be used in combination with blue or yellow sticky traps to monitor and reduce thrips numbers.

Thrips management involves starting to spray at the first sign of infestation and repeating at 7-10-day intervals under high pressure. It is essential to ensure good coverage of leaf undersides where thrips cluster. To prevent thrips, avoid dense planting and excessive nitrogen, which favor their development. Encouraging natural enemies such as predatory thrips, lacewings, and lady beetles by reducing broad-spectrum sprays is also beneficial. Maintaining field sanitation and removing weed hosts can help prevent thrips infestations.

Aphids, such as Myzus persicae, cluster on the undersides of leaves, sucking sap and causing yellowing, distortion, and stunted growth. Honeydew secretion leads to sooty mould on leaves and bulbs, reducing photosynthesis and market quality. Aphids may also transmit viral diseases. To manage aphids, systemic insecticides such as Imidacloprid or Acetamiprid can be used at label-recommended doses. In organic or integrated pest management systems, neem-based sprays, azadirachtin, or pyrethrin-like bio-pesticides can be effective.

Regular scouting and spraying at the first sign of infestation are crucial in managing aphid populations. Combining biological control and yellow sticky traps can help monitor aphid populations. To prevent aphid infestations, using resistant or tolerant varieties where available is recommended. Maintaining field sanitation and removing alternate weed hosts can also help prevent aphid infestations. Encouraging natural enemies by reducing harsh insecticides can also be beneficial.

Onion tuber maturity signs include yellowing and natural falling over of leaves, neck softening, and bulbs becoming firm with dried outer scales. Harvesting and curing are essential steps in onion production to ensure high-quality bulbs.



Plants look mature and are ready for lifting. Harvesting should begin when about 50-70% of plants show natural lodging and leaves are yellowing and drying. It is essential to lift bulbs carefully with a spade or fork to avoid bruising; pulling by hand can damage the neck and increase the risk of rot. After lifting, dry the bulbs in the field for 3-5 days, arranging them in single layers with tops spread out, until the outer skins are dry and the necks are completely dry.

Following field-drying, shift the bulbs to a shaded, well-ventilated shed and continue curing for 10-15 days until the necks are fully dry and the outer skins are crisp. During this process, remove excess soil and outer dried leaves, but avoid removing too many layers that expose the flesh. Proper curing is crucial to prevent the spread of rot and ensure the quality of the bulbs.

For storage, place the cured bulbs in cool, dry, well-ventilated storage, ideally at a temperature of 0-4°C and 65-70% humidity, in mesh bags or crates that allow air circulation. Before storage, sort out soft, bruised, or diseased bulbs to prevent the spread of rot. Avoid storing the bulbs in damp, humid, or poorly ventilated godowns, as this encourages fungal rots and sprouting.

For rabi onion, popular varieties such as Bhima Super, Prema 178, Nasik Red (N-53), Laxmi, or other region-recommended varieties suited to your state should be used. In North India, rabi onion is usually sown in nursery during September-October and transplanted in November-December. In South India, onion is also grown in kharif and late kharif seasons, so follow local advisories on sowing and transplanting windows. Choose varieties with good shelf-life and resistance or tolerance to common diseases, such as purple blotch, downy mildew, and white rot, where available.

When planting onion, avoid using non-recommended or unknown exotic varieties without local testing. Never reuse seed from highly diseased fields; always source certified seed or healthy sets from reputable suppliers. Proper irrigation is essential for onion growth. Give light, frequent irrigation in early stages to ensure good stand and growth. During bulb-formation and bulking, maintain even moisture; irrigate about every 5-7 days depending on soil and weather, avoiding waterlogging. Reduce irrigation 2-3 weeks before harvest to allow necks to dry and reduce bulb rot in storage.

In terms of field structure, use raised beds or broad-bed furrows in heavy soils to improve drainage and prevent root and bulb rot. In sandy soils, use flat beds or wide beds with good organic matter incorporation to retain moisture. Avoid compacted or water-ponding areas in the field to reduce disease pressure. Practice drip or shallow furrow irrigation where feasible, and never leave onion standing in water-logged or flooded fields for more than 6-8 hours.

Weeds compete with onion plants, reducing growth and bulb size, and also shelter pests and diseases. Perform 2-3 hoeings or light inter-cultivation at 15-20 days intervals after planting, depending on weed pressure. Apply pre-emergence herbicide as per local advisory where used, combined with mechanical weeding. Remove weeds before they flower to reduce seed-bank build-up in the field. Incorporate 10-15 t/ha of FYM or compost during land preparation to improve soil structure and fertility. Avoid cultivating when soil is too wet; this causes compaction and reduces aeration. After harvest, plough and expose the soil to sunlight and air to reduce nematode and disease build-up. Rotate onion with non-bulb crops such as cereals, pulses, or brassicas to reduce repeated stress and disease cycles.
